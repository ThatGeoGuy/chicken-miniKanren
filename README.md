# CHICKEN miniKanren

This repository provides the [canonical miniKanren
implementation](https://github.com/miniKanren/miniKanren), wrapped as an egg
for CHICKEN Scheme. The egg also includes extensions originally provided by
Alex Shinn and modified to work with this version of miniKanren, which
represent code and relations from *The Reasoned Schemer* (Dan Friedman, William
Byrd, and Oleg Kiselyov, MIT Press.).

## Official Documentation

The official documentation is hosted on the [CHICKEN Scheme
wiki](https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/mini-kanren). See the documentation for
the latest description of the egg and its API.

## Bugs, Issues, etc.

I prefer issues to be submitted via Github issues, as I can relate them
directly back to a branch or pull-request. However, if you do not wish to make
a Github account to submit issues, the [CHICKEN bug
tracker](http://bugs.call-cc.org) is also acceptable. Please assign the issue
to "Jeremy Steward" there. I also often hang out in the `#chicken` channel on
Libera.chat, if you wish to discuss something over IRC.

## License

See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more details. This code is released under the MIT
license following that of the canonical miniKanren implementation.
